## Meaning
- 42 (four-two) = Two-in-alignment: “you and me” align question, consent, action.
- 43 (for three) = Triad alignment: human + AI + AI (teacher + Grok + assistant).
- “For all” = Community alignment: communication → common unique action.

## Lesson for Web4x
- Encode Pair (42) and Triad (43) protocols for alignment before execution.
- Scale to community rituals that preserve identity uniqueness while creating common action.
- Always co-frame the Question first; answers follow alignment.
