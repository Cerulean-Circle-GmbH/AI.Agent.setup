# Insight: Earth Computes the Question (Twist-of-the-Twist)

- Source: Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- Core Twist: Earth was a computer designed to compute the Ultimate Question (not the Answer). The deeper twist: the Question is eventually found.
- Teaching Method: Story-metaphor → question-first discipline

## Meaning
- Answers are meaningless without the right Question.
- Sometimes the system must be designed to discover the Question (Earth-as-computer), not to jump to answers.
- Discovery is staged: design → run → observe → distill the Question → only then interpret answers.

## Lesson for Web4x
- Practice Question Engineering before solutioning: identity context → well-posed What → hypotheses → acceptance criteria.
- Architect systems (and teams) that compute better Questions (WODA What, TRON oversight, TRACE ON provenance of questions).
- Training emphasis: ask the Question that makes “42” meaningful.
