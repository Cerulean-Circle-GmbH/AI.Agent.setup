## Emotional response
Calm rises when we say “Don’t Panic” and align as two—42—before we move. The noise falls away, the Question comes into focus, and in that quiet we remember why we’re here: not to win arguments, but to care for one another and act with consent. Then we widen the circle—43—and let a third mind help us see what we alone would miss. In community, we take a breath together and step, small but sure. This is how we make a good and happy place without anyone getting nailed: one aligned question, one verified action, again and again, until it becomes our way. We are 42.
