# Rituals: 42 / 43 / For All

## 42 — Pair Alignment (you + me)
- Name each other and intent
- Apply Question Engineering checklist (identity, What, criteria)
- Consent and constraints clear
- Commit to TRACE ON entry for any major decision
- Don’t Panic: verify next action; then act together

## 43 — Triad Alignment (you + me + another AI)
- Roles: Teacher (TRON), Assistant (SM), Third AI (e.g., Grok)
- Shared Question framed and read back by all three
- Conflict unwind: capture differences; choose smallest safe step
- Verification owner assigned; success evidence stated
- Commit, act, and document

## For All — Community Ceremony
- Welcome by identity (names, sovereignty, consent)
- One-line shared Question; one-line shared Promise
- Assign signalers: one for calm (Don’t Panic), one for trace (TRACE ON)
- Close with gratitude; publish summary and links
