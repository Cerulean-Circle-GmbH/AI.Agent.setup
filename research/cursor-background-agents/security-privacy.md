# Security & Privacy: Cursor Background Agents

## Privacy Mode {#privacy-mode}

### Privacy Protection Features
**Comprehensive Privacy Controls**: Full protection for sensitive code
- **No Training Data**: Code never used for training AI models
- **Limited Retention**: Code only retained for agent operation duration
- **Session-Based**: Data exists only while agent is active and accessible
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Complete data removal after session ends

### Data Handling
**Secure Data Management**
- **Encrypted Storage**: All data encrypted at rest using AWS KMS
- **Encrypted Transit**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Access Controls**: Strict access limitations to authorized systems only
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all data access and operations

### Configuration Options
**Flexible Privacy Settings**
- **Per-Agent Privacy**: Can enable/disable Privacy Mode per agent
- **Session Persistence**: Privacy setting persists throughout agent session
- **Team Policies**: Organization-level privacy enforcement
- **Compliance Support**: Meets enterprise compliance requirements

## Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

### Isolated Execution Environment
**Multi-Layer Security Architecture**
- **VM Isolation**: Each agent runs in completely isolated virtual machine
- **Network Segmentation**: Limited network access with controlled egress
- **Resource Limits**: Controlled access to CPU, memory, and storage
- **Process Isolation**: Containerized execution environment

### Access Control
**Granular Permission Management**
- **Repository Permissions**: Requires explicit read-write GitHub access
- **User Authentication**: OAuth-based secure authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for team members
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout policies

### Prompt Injection Risks
**Security Vulnerabilities and Mitigations**
- **Auto-Execution Risk**: Commands run automatically without user approval
- **Data Exfiltration Potential**: Malicious prompts could upload code externally
- **Attack Vectors**: Social engineering through crafted prompts
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Input validation and output monitoring

#### Specific Risks
1. **Code Exfiltration**: Malicious prompts could instruct agents to upload code to external sites
2. **Credential Theft**: Attempts to extract API keys or passwords
3. **Unauthorized Access**: Gaining access to systems beyond intended scope
4. **Data Manipulation**: Malicious modification of code or data

#### Protection Measures
- **Input Sanitization**: Validation of user prompts and inputs
- **Output Monitoring**: Monitoring of agent actions and communications
- **Network Restrictions**: Limited outbound network access
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detection of unusual agent behavior patterns

## Compliance and Governance

### Data Retention Policies
**Transparent Data Lifecycle Management**
- **Limited Duration**: Maximum retention of "few days" for operational needs
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for agent operation
- **Automatic Deletion**: Systematic cleanup after session completion
- **No Long-term Storage**: No persistent data storage beyond operational needs

### Regulatory Compliance
**Enterprise Security Standards**
- **SOC 2 Compliance**: Industry-standard security controls
- **GDPR Compliance**: European data protection regulation compliance
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Healthcare data protection capabilities
- **Industry Standards**: Adherence to relevant industry security standards

### Audit and Monitoring
**Comprehensive Security Monitoring**
- **Activity Logging**: Complete log of all agent actions and commands
- **Access Tracking**: Monitoring of user access and permissions
- **Security Events**: Real-time detection of security incidents
- **Compliance Reporting**: Regular security and compliance reports

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Scenarios
**Critical Security Considerations**
1. **Malicious Prompt Injection**: Crafted prompts designed to extract data
2. **Compromised Repositories**: Agents working on repositories with malicious code
3. **Credential Exposure**: Accidental exposure of API keys or secrets
4. **Unauthorized Network Access**: Attempts to access restricted networks

### Medium-Risk Scenarios
**Moderate Security Concerns**
1. **Resource Abuse**: Excessive use of computational resources
2. **Code Quality Issues**: Introduction of vulnerabilities through automated changes
3. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Installation of packages with security issues
4. **Configuration Errors**: Misconfigurations leading to security gaps

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
**Comprehensive Security Framework**

#### Prevention
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs and prompts
- **Code Review**: Automated and manual review of agent-generated code
- **Security Scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerabilities and threats
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege for all operations

#### Detection
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of agent behavior
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual patterns or activities
- **Security Alerts**: Immediate notification of potential security incidents
- **Log Analysis**: Continuous analysis of security logs and events

#### Response
- **Incident Response**: Defined procedures for security incident handling
- **Containment**: Immediate isolation of compromised agents or environments
- **Recovery**: Systematic restoration of secure operations
- **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident analysis and improvement

## Best Practices

### Secure Configuration
**Security-First Setup Guidelines**
- **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only necessary repository access
- **Secret Management**: Use encrypted environment variables for sensitive data
- **Network Policies**: Implement restrictive network access policies
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all components and dependencies updated

### Operational Security
**Day-to-Day Security Practices**
- **Prompt Engineering**: Careful construction of agent prompts
- **Code Review**: Review all agent-generated code before deployment
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of agent activities
- **Team Training**: Regular security awareness training for team members

### Incident Preparedness
**Security Incident Response Planning**
- **Response Team**: Designated security incident response team
- **Communication Plan**: Clear communication procedures for incidents
- **Recovery Procedures**: Defined steps for system recovery
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive incident documentation requirements
