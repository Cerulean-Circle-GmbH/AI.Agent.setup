# What: Cursor Background Agents

**ðŸ“– For comprehensive details**: See [Overview](./overview.md) for complete analysis and cross-referenced findings.


## Quick Definition

**Cursor Background Agents** are asynchronous remote agents that edit and run code in isolated Ubuntu-based environments, enabling continuous autonomous development without constant user interaction.

## Core Capabilities
- **Autonomous Operation**: Work independently in remote VMs
- **Auto-Execution**: Run terminal commands and tests automatically  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status with intervention capabilities
- **Seamless Handoff**: Easy transition between agent and human work

## Key Benefits
- **Isolated Environment**: No impact on local system
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic branch management and repository operations
- **Continuous Iteration**: Test, fix, and iterate automatically
- **Team Collaboration**: Easy sharing and handoff capabilities

## Essential Constraints  
- Requires GitHub read-write permissions
- Limited to few days data retention
- Only Max Mode-compatible models
- Internet connectivity required
