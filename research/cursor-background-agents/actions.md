# Actions: Cursor Background Agents Implementation Guide

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Setup and Configuration
**Create Environment Configuration**
- [ ] Set up `.cursor/environment.json` in your repository
- [ ] Configure install commands for your project dependencies
- [ ] Define startup commands if needed (e.g., Docker services)
- [ ] Add terminal sessions for development servers

**Example environment.json**:
```json
{
  "snapshot": "POPULATED_FROM_SETTINGS",
  "install": "npm install && pip install -r requirements.txt",
  "start": "sudo service docker start",
  "terminals": [
    {
      "name": "Development Server",
      "command": "npm run dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "Test Runner",
      "command": "npm run test:watch"
    }
  ]
}
```
