pip install -r requirements.txt && python setup.py develop
```

**Full-Stack Projects**:
```bash
npm install && pip install -r requirements.txt && composer install
```

  "terminals": [
    {
      "name": "Application Logs",
      "command": "docker-compose logs -f"
    },
    {
      "name": "Database Console",
