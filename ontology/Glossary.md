# System Glossary

## A

### Agent
A software component that performs tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often in the background.

### Automation Agent
A specialized agent designed to automate repetitive tasks and workflows.

## B

### Background Agent
An agent that runs persistently in the background without requiring direct user interaction. See: Cursor Background Agents.

### Backlink
A reference from one document back to another document that links to it, creating bidirectional navigation.

### Bootstrap
The process of initializing a system using a minimal set of instructions or components.

### Bootstrap System
A minimal system responsible for initializing and starting larger systems or components. ONCE Kernel is the universal bootstrap system.

## C

### Cross-Reference
A link or reference from one document to related documents, enabling navigation between related content.

### Cross-Reference Agent
An automated system that generates cross-references and backlinks between related markdown files following WODA methodology.

### Cursor
An AI-powered IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that provides coding assistance and automation features.

### Cursor Background Agents
A feature in Cursor IDE allowing autonomous agents to run tasks in the background in isolated containers.

## D

### Delegation Model
An architectural pattern where complex functionality is delegated to appropriate layers rather than embedded in core systems.

## I

### Interoperability
The ability of different systems to work together and exchange information seamlessly.

### Interoperating System
A system designed to facilitate communication and interaction between different platforms and architectures. ONCE Kernel is the universal interoperating system.

## K

### Kernel
The core component of an operating system or platform that manages fundamental operations. See: ONCE Kernel.

## L

### Linux Kernel
The core of Linux operating systems, managing hardware resources and system calls. ONCE Kernel follows a similar naming convention.

## M

### Markdown
A lightweight markup language used for formatting text documents, commonly used for documentation.

### Microkernel
An architectural approach emphasizing a minimal kernel with most services running in user space.

### Minimalism Principle
The design philosophy of maintaining the smallest possible footprint while providing essential functionality.

## O

### Object
In the context of ONCE Kernel, any entity that can be booted and managed by the system.

### ONCE
An incredibly small interoperating system that boots everything and every object. Synonymous with ONCE Kernel.

### ONCE Kernel
The formal name for ONCE, emphasizing its role as the core interoperating system (similar to "Linux kernel"). ONCE and ONCE Kernel refer to the same system.

### Ontology
A formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.

## T

### Topic Detection
The process of automatically identifying key subjects and themes within documents for categorization and linking.

### TRON (Trace Record Oversight Network)
Governance and accountability authority. Provides strategic direction, quality validation, correction, and final approval. Originates the TRACE ON discipline.

### Tester (QA)
Quality Assurance role validating features end-to-end (manual and automated), documenting findings, and signing off on releases.

### TRACE ON
Traceability discipline requiring each major decision to record TRON source, context, implementation, verification, and accountability. Logged in `TRON_ACCOUNTABILITY_LOG.md`.

## U

### Universal Bootstrap
The capability to initialize any type of system or object using a single, unified mechanism. ONCE Kernel provides universal bootstrap functionality.

### Universal Bootstrap Principle
The principle that a single, minimal system should be capable of initializing all other systems and objects.

## W

### WODA
A documentation methodology organizing content into four sections:
- **W**hat: Quick definition and key concepts
- **O**verview: High-level understanding and structure
- **D**etails: In-depth technical information
- **A**ctions: Practical implementation steps

### WODA Methodology
The structured approach to documentation using What, Overview, Details, and Actions sections.

## Special Terms

### "Boots Everything"
A key characteristic of ONCE Kernel, meaning it can initialize and start any type of entity or object in the system.

### "Incredibly Small"
A defining feature of ONCE Kernel, emphasizing its minimal footprint and essential-only design philosophy.

### "Every Thing and Every Object"
The universal scope of ONCE Kernel's bootstrap capability, encompassing all system entities without exception.

## Abbreviations

- **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment
- **ONCE**: The universal bootstrap and interoperating system (not an acronym, but a name)
- **WODA**: What-Overview-Details-Actions

## Usage Notes

1. **ONCE vs ONCE Kernel**: These terms are interchangeable. Use "ONCE Kernel" when emphasizing its role as a kernel or when comparing to other kernels like Linux kernel.

2. **Bootstrap vs Boot**: "Bootstrap" refers to the initialization process, while "boot" is the action of starting something up.

3. **Interoperating vs Interoperable**: "Interoperating" describes active cooperation between systems, while "interoperable" describes the capability to cooperate.
