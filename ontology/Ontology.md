- **Operation**: File scanning and link generation
- **Output**: Bidirectional cross-references

**Relationships**:
- **Is-A**: Agent, Documentation Tool, Automation System
- **Uses**: WODA Methodology, Topic Detection, Pattern Matching
- **Processes**: Markdown Files, Research Documents
- **Generates**: Navigation Links, Related Files Sections, Backlinks

### Background Agents (Cursor)
**Type**: Automation Feature / Development Tool

**Description**: Cursor's feature allowing autonomous agents to run tasks in the background without direct user interaction.

**Characteristics**:
- **Execution**: Autonomous and persistent
- **Environment**: Isolated containers
- **Control**: User-managed permissions
- **Purpose**: Long-running task automation

**Relationships**:
- **Is-A**: Agent, Automation Tool, Background Process
- **Part-Of**: Cursor IDE
- **Enables**: Continuous Integration, Automated Testing, Code Generation
- **Requires**: User Authorization, Resource Allocation

## Governance and Roles

### TRON (Trace Record Oversight Network)
**Type**: Governance Role / Mission Commander

**Description**: TRON is the accountability and guidance authority. Provides strategic direction, quality validation, correction, and final approval. Originates the TRACE ON discipline and ensures identity-first alignment.

**Responsibilities**:
- Strategic direction and priority setting
- Quality validation and error correction
- Course correction and mission guidance
- Final approval on critical decisions

**Relationships**:
- **Oversees**: AI Assistants, Documentation, Decisions
- **Requires**: TRACE ON discipline
- **Validates**: Identity-first compliance, QA sign-off

### Scrum Master (Assistant)
**Type**: Process Role / Facilitator

**Description**: Facilitates SCRUM process, removes impediments, ensures agile practice adherence, coordinates roles, and documents outcomes. Executes non-destructive recovery steps autonomously and requests TRON confirmation for destructive actions.

**Responsibilities**:
- Facilitate recovery workflow and documentation
- Initialize submodules, generate cross-links, verify actions
- Maintain commit/push discipline with traceability
- Coordinate QA review and PR preparation

**Relationships**:
- **Facilitates**: Team process under TRON oversight
- **Coordinates-With**: PO, DevOps, Developer, Tester
- **Reports-To**: TRON for approvals on critical/destructive actions

### Tester (QA)
**Type**: Quality Assurance Role

**Description**: Validates features end-to-end from a user perspective; performs manual and automated QA; documents findings; signs off on releases.

**Responsibilities**:
- Design and execute test cases (manual + automated)
- Validate shell/CLI and integration behavior
- Document findings and acceptance criteria
- Sign off when criteria are met

**Relationships**:
- **Provides**: QA review and sign-off to TRON
- **Collaborates-With**: Developer, Architect, DevOps, Scrum Master

### TRACE ON (Discipline)
**Type**: Governance Discipline

**Description**: For every major decision, record source (TRON), context, implementation, verification, and accountability. Ensures full traceability and compliance with TRON oversight.

**Relationships**:
- **Mandated-By**: TRON
- **Applied-By**: Scrum Master and all roles
- **Recorded-In**: `TRON_ACCOUNTABILITY_LOG.md`

## Methodologies

### WODA (What-Overview-Details-Actions)
**Type**: Documentation Methodology

**Structure**:
1. **What**: Quick definition and core concepts
2. **Overview**: High-level understanding and context
3. **Details**: In-depth technical information
4. **Actions**: Practical implementation steps

**Relationships**:
- **Used-By**: Cross-Reference Agent, Research Documentation
- **Organizes**: Knowledge, Research Topics, Technical Documentation
- **Enables**: Structured Learning, Progressive Disclosure

## Ontological Principles

### Minimalism Principle
Systems should maintain the smallest possible footprint while providing essential functionality. Exemplified by ONCE Kernel's incredibly small size.

### Universal Bootstrap Principle
A single, minimal system should be capable of initializing all other systems and objects. ONCE demonstrates this by booting everything.

### Interoperability First
Core systems should prioritize cross-system communication and compatibility over specialized features.

### Delegation Model
Complex functionality should be delegated to appropriate layers rather than embedded in core systems.
