# Ontology Documentation

This directory contains the formal ontology and glossary for the system, with special emphasis on **ONCE Kernel** - the incredibly small interoperating system that boots everything.

## Key Concepts

### ONCE Kernel
ONCE (also known as ONCE Kernel) is the foundational interoperating system with these key characteristics:
- **Incredibly small** footprint
- **Boots everything** and every object
- **Universal bootstrap** capability
- **Core interoperability** layer

The term "ONCE Kernel" emphasizes its role as the core interoperating system, similar to how "Linux kernel" describes the core of Linux systems. ONCE and ONCE Kernel are interchangeable terms.

### Cross-Reference System
The ontology is automatically cross-referenced using the Cross-Reference Agent, which:
- Detects relationships between concepts
- Generates bidirectional links
- Maintains navigation structures
- Follows WODA methodology

## File Descriptions

### Ontology.md
The main ontology file containing:
- System hierarchies
- Relationship mappings
- Ontological principles
- Core system definitions

### Glossary.md
Comprehensive glossary including:
- Term definitions
- Abbreviations
- Usage notes
- Special terminology for ONCE Kernel

### concepts/ONCE-kernel.md
Detailed documentation of ONCE Kernel:
- Architecture philosophy
- Bootstrap capabilities
- Comparison with other kernels
- Implementation notes

### concepts/definitions.md
Core concept definitions for:
- ONCE/ONCE Kernel
- Cross-Reference Agent
- Background Agents
- WODA Methodology

## Usage

These files are designed to be:
1. **Reference Documentation**: Look up terms and concepts
2. **Learning Resources**: Understand system architecture
3. **Integration Points**: Copy to external documentation systems

## External Integration

To integrate with external documentation systems, copy these files to:
- `EAMD.ucp/Documentation/Ontology.md`
- `EAMD.ucp/Documentation/Glossary.md`

Note: The system cannot directly write to external directories outside the workspace.

## Maintenance

The ontology is maintained through:
1. Manual updates for new concepts
2. Automatic cross-referencing via the Cross-Link Agent
3. Regular review and validation
