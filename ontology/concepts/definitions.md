# Core Concept Definitions

## System Components

### ONCE / ONCE Kernel
**Definition**: An incredibly small interoperating system that boots everything and every object. ONCE and ONCE Kernel are the same system - the term "ONCE Kernel" emphasizes its role as the core interoperating system (similar to "Linux kernel").

**Key Properties**:
- Incredibly small footprint
- Universal bootstrap capability
- Boots every thing and every object
- Core interoperability layer

### Cross-Reference Agent
**Definition**: An automated system that generates cross-references and backlinks between related markdown files, following WODA methodology.

**Key Properties**:
- Automatic topic detection
- Bidirectional relationship mapping
- Navigation enhancement
- WODA structure linking

### Background Agents
**Definition**: Cursor's feature allowing autonomous agents to run tasks in the background without direct user interaction.

**Key Properties**:
- Autonomous execution
- Background processing
- Task automation
- Persistent operation

## Methodologies

### WODA
**Definition**: A structured documentation methodology organizing content into What, Overview, Details, and Actions.

**Components**:
- **What**: Quick definition and key concepts
- **Overview**: High-level understanding and structure
- **Details**: In-depth technical information
- **Actions**: Practical implementation steps

## System Relationships

### Interoperating Systems
**Definition**: Systems designed to work together seamlessly, sharing data and functionality across different platforms and architectures.

**Examples**:
- ONCE Kernel as universal interoperating layer
- Cross-platform communication protocols
- Universal object models

### Bootstrap Systems
**Definition**: Minimal systems responsible for initializing and starting larger systems or components.

**Examples**:
- ONCE Kernel booting all objects
- System initialization sequences
- Universal startup protocols
